# WPF Basic Log In Screen
This is a simple log in screen similar to those found in real world applications.

****REQUIRED INFORMATION****
I created this in early 2018 when first familiarizing myself with the WPF/XAML technology.
This project is a great starting point for experimentation or even wiring up to a relational database to valid user inputted credentials.

Feel free to download, modify, and experiment with this clean and simple C# app!
